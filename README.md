# csc648-sp19-Team205

## How to start
1. Install Node.js ver. 10 https://nodejs.org/en/.
2. Clone development branch from github. Make sure to switch to development branch after using "git checkout development" if you haven't already.
3. In cloned git folder navigate to the server (e.g ./csc648-sp19-team205/server). The folder should have a public folder and index.js
4. In that directory open a terminal type
...
npm install
...
5. A folder called node_modules should show up.

##Testing locally

Once you have setup the folders and installed the node.js modules you can now test it.

Navigate again to the server folder and in a terminal run:
...
node index.js
...

This will start a localy server. So make sure to give node access permissions to do so if your OS asks for it.

Open a browser then go to http://localhost:3000/
